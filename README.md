## üî¨ Lab Overview

### Lab 01: Intro to Layout Editor & Transistor Design
- **Kickstart your design journey:** Learn the ropes of Cadence's layout editor as you design basic NMOS and PMOS transistors, with a focus on Design Rule Checks (DRC) to perfect your layouts.

### Lab 02: CMOS Inverter Design & LVS
- **From schematic to silicon:** Design and simulate a CMOS inverter, ensuring layout accuracy with Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) checks. A critical step in the IC design process!

### Lab 03: Parasitic Extraction & Post-Layout Sim
- **Bridging theory and practice:** Extract parasitics and run post-layout simulations to see how real-world factors influence your design. This lab emphasizes the importance of PEX in IC design.

### Lab 04: NAND & AND Gate Design
- **Building logic:** Create layouts for 2-input CMOS NAND and AND gates. Validate your designs with DRC, LVS, and PEX, and simulate to verify functionality.

### Lab 05: XOR Gate Design
- **Complexity in simplicity:** Design a 2-input CMOS XOR gate, navigating the challenges of layout design, DRC, LVS, and PEX, all leading to a robust post-layout simulation.

### Lab 06: Resistors in TSMC 65nm
- **Exploring resistive elements:** Design and simulate metal, poly, and diffusion resistors, understanding their behavior and applications within the TSMC 65nm process.

### Lab 07: Capacitors in TSMC 65nm
- **Capacitance unleashed:** Dive into MIM and MOM capacitors, learning the intricacies of their layout design, parasitic extraction, and capacitance estimation.

### Lab 09: Differential Pair Layout & Matching
- **Precision and accuracy:** Design a CMOS differential pair using advanced matching techniques like interdigitization. This lab focuses on noise isolation and layout accuracy.

### Lab 10: Final Project - 5T OTA Layout
- **Bringing it all together:** Apply everything you've learned to design a 5-transistor operational transconductance amplifier (OTA), using advanced matching techniques. A capstone project that tests your skills and knowledge.
